# Laptop Rentals
# You're given a list of time intervals during which students at a school need a laptop.
#These time intervals are represented by pairs of integers [start, end], where â€¢ <= start < end.
#However, start and end don't represent real times; therefore, they may be greater than 24.
# No two students can use a laptop at the same time, but immediately after a student is done using a laptop, another student can use that same laptop.
#For example, if one student rents a laptop during the time interval [0, 2], another student can rent the same laptop during any time interval starting with 2.
# # Write a function that returns the minimum number of laptops that the school needs to rent such that all students will always have access to a laptop
# times =
# [
# [0, 2],
# [1, 4],
# [4, 6],
# [0, 4],
# [7, 8],
# [9, 11],
# [3, 10]]
#Sample Output : 3
