#Detect Arbitrage. Will Do it Using Bellmon-Ford Algorithm
# You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of equal height and width that represents the exchange rates of arbitrary currencies.
# The length of the array is the number of currencies, and every currency can be converted to every other currency. Each currency is represented by a row in the array, where values in that row are the floating-point exchange rates between the row's currency and all other currencies, as in the example below.
# 0:USD 1:CAD 2:GBP
# 0:USD  [1.0, 1.27, 0.718]
# 1:CAD  [0.74, 1.0, 0.56]
# 2: GBP [1.39, 1.77, 1.0]
# In the matrix above, you can see that row â€¢ represents USD, which means that row e contains the exchange rates for 1 USD to all other currencies.
# Since row 1 represents CAD, index 1 in the USD row contains the exchange for 1 USD to CAD.
# The currency labels are listed above to help you visualize the problem, but they won't actually be included in any inputs and aren't relevant to solving this problem.
# Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether an arbitrage opportunity exists with the given exchange rates.
# An arbitrage occurs if you can start with C units of one currency and execute a series of exchanges that lead you to having more than C units of the same currency you started with.
# Note: currency exchange rates won't represent real-world exchange rates, and there might be multiple ways to generate an arbitrage.
# Sample Output:
# exchangeRates= [
# [1, 0.8631, 0.5903],
# [1.1586, 1, 0.6849],
# [1.6939, 1.46, 1]
# ]
#  Input: true
