# You're given a two-dimensional array that represents a 9x9 partially filled Sudoku board.
# Write a function that returns the solved Sudoku board.
# Sudoku is a famous number-placement puzzle in which you need to fill a 9x9 grid with integers in the range of 1-9.
# Each 9x9 Sudoku board is split into 9 3x3 subgrids, as seen in the illustration below, and starts out partially filled.

#     [7, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0],
#     [6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],
#     [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 7, 8],
